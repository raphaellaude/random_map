# random_map

Python tools to generate random maps. In development.
Notebooks are a mess for now.

## slime.py

Slime mold -esque algorithm to generate data for road networks.

## To-do

- Mapping
  - [ ] Determine road network based on slime mold output.
  - [ ] Generate base layers (use Perlin noise or something similar?).
- Slime
  - [ ] Take semi-random step home rather than direct step home.
  - [ ] Implement terrain avoidance (different treatment for slope versus water)
- General
  - [ ] Clean up notebooks
